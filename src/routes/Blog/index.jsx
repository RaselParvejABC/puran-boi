            How does Prototypical Inheritance work?
          </Card.Title>
          <p>
            Prototypical Inheritance works at Object-level, in contrast to
            Class-based Inheritance, which works at Class-level.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Prototypical Inheritance, a object inherits attributes from
            another object, which can change in a program's runtime, as object
            is a runtime in-memory entity, whereas class is a compile-time
            entity.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, in Class-based Inheritance, it's not an object
            that inherits. It is the object's class that inherits from another
            class or classes (not another object or objects).

            What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
          </Card.Title>
          <p>
            A unit might mean a function, a method, a procedure, a module, or an
            objectâ€” small pieces that make a big software.
          </p>
          <p>A Unit Test means testing such an elemental unit.</p>
          <p>
            Unit tests are followed by larger-scale tests. Unit tests narrow
            down the number of things we should test on on later larger-scale
            test, thus saving time and giving us a solid ground for those
            larger-scale tests.

            What are the differences among React, Angular and Vue?
          </Card.Title>
          <p>
            React is a library, not a complete framework. So you need
            third-party tools, libraries, module etc. On the other hand, Angular
            is a Full-fledged Framework, not just a library.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vue is easier to learn that React. But React is more suited to
            larger and more complex applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vue is the clear choice for less experienced developers, and Angular
            would be preferred for those working on larger apps.
